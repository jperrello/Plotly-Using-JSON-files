# Plotly-Using-JSON-files
This is a repository for my practice code in which bar charts are created using Plotly JS and JSON files. It can display information and let the user select specific bars to gather information.

The HTML file is primarily used to test my javascript code. I know for the purposes of this code, I already have access to a website. So features like uploading the file on a webpage and then parsing the data can be done within the javascript code, but because CORS errors I had to use this work around for now. The important part of this repo is the javascript code and how the bars are created and correctly formatted.
